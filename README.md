# Retail Purchase Analysis

## Project Description

### 1. Project Problem
The retail industry often struggles to accurately understand and segment its customer base, leading to ineffective marketing strategies and suboptimal customer engagement. This challenge can result in lost sales opportunities and diminished customer satisfaction.

### 2. Solution
This project leverages customer data to perform customer segmentation using the K-means clustering algorithm. By analyzing variables such as annual income and spending scores, we identify distinct customer segments. These insights enable the creation of targeted marketing strategies, improving customer satisfaction and increasing sales.

### 3. Tools Used
- **Python**: For data analysis and processing.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizing data and clustering results.
- **Scikit-learn**: For applying the K-means clustering algorithm.
