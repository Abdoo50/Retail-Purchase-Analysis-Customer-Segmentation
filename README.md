## Project Overview

Retailers can gain a competitive edge by understanding customer segments and tailoring their offerings accordingly. This project aims to:

1. Perform customer segmentation using K-means clustering.
2. Analyze customer behavior based on annual income and spending scores.
3. Provide actionable insights to enhance marketing strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the **Mall Customers** dataset, which contains information about customers' annual income, spending score, and other demographic details.

- **Columns**:
  - `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
  - `Gender`: Gender of the customer.
  - `Age`: Age of the customer.
  - `Annual Income (k$)`: Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
  - `Spending Score (1-100)`: A score assigned based on the customerâ€™s behavior and spending nature.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or above installed.

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the notebook `retail-purchase-analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run the cells sequentially to perform the analysis.

## Analysis Process

The analysis is divided into the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Load the customer data into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the data distribution, check for missing values, and perform descriptive statistics.
3. **Data Visualization**: Visualize the distribution of key features such as age, annual income, and spending score.
4. **K-means Clustering**: Apply the K-means algorithm to group customers into distinct segments based on their annual income and spending score.
5. **Cluster Analysis**: Analyze the characteristics of each cluster to derive insights.

## Results

The analysis identified [number] distinct customer segments. Key findings include:

- **High Income, High Spending**: A small but valuable segment of customers who spend significantly.
- **Low Income, Low Spending**: A large segment that may require different marketing strategies.

These insights can be used to tailor marketing campaigns, improve customer retention, and optimize product offerings.
